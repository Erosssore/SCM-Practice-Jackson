## What is SCM?
SCM stands for 'source code management'. These tools manage and store different versions of
your applications configuration like source code files, application-specific configuration data,
test cases, etc. GitHub helps support open-source SCM at scale by allowing developers
to collaborate on projects using the file management system, issues page, pull requests
(update requests), etc.
